# Boolean Data Type

- The boolean data type is a primitive type that can store two possible values: "true" or "false"
- This data type typically used for decision-making in programs, 
such as checking conditions and controlling the flow of code


### Usage of Boolean Type

* Boolean variable are often used to represent the outcome of logical conditions.
* To create boolean variable: 
 ```java
boolean isEmpty = false;
boolean canPass = true;
```

# Comparison Operators
- Comparison operators are used to compare two values. These comparisons yield a boolean 
result('true' or 'false'). The result of the comparison can be stored in a boolean variable
or used directly in conditional statements (if loops)

|   Operator      |   Symbol   |                   Description                     |    Example   |   Result   |
|   Equal To      |      ==    |          Checks if two values are equal           |     4==4     |    True    |
| Not Equal To    |      !=    |         Check if two values are not equal         |     4!=4     |    False   |     
| Greater than    |       >    |         Check if the left values is greater       |    11 > 7    |    True    |
|  Less than      |       <    |         Check if the left value is smaller        |    7 < 11    |    True    |
|Greater or Equal |     >=     |          Check if the left is greater or equal    |   14 >= 14   |    True    |
|Less or Equal    |      <=    |         Check if the left is smaller or equal     |   21 <= 30   |    True    |
